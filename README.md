# takaramOS
Donation platform using python and mongodb
This is platform for donations. Say you have things laying around and that you do not need. What many would tell you to do is to sell them.  This platform is intended to help people give to others. Something you may not need may be very useful to someone else.
Do not hold back and start giving.

This version is the alpha version many features are missing. Hopefully I will be add more features to it as time progresses. Feel free to tune in and help the way you want.
